# Mandelbrot-Set

Application for visualizing the Mandelbrot Set, I've always loved fractles and I chose to do this project out of personal interest as a way to work on practicing a more interactive and visual application.

works best when window size is 1920 * 1080 otherwise there are slight offset issues when 
zooming in and out. 

Controls
i - zoom in
o - zoom out
c - display crosshair 
arrow keys - control offset
